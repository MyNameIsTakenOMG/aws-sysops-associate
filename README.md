## EC2 for SysOps

- changing instance types (only for EBS-backed instances): stop the instance, apply change, then restart the instance
- enhanced networking:
  - EC2 enhanced networking(sr-iov): elastic network adapter(higher bandwidth)
  - Elastic fabric adapter: improved ENA, `only works for linux`, great for tightly coupled workloads
- placement groups:
  - cluster: cluster instances into a low-latency group in a AZ, if AZ fails, all instances will fail
  - spread: 7 instances per group per AZ (critical apps)
  - partition: up to 7 partitions per AZ, up to 100 instances per group
- shutdown behavior & termination protection
  - not from `aws console` or `aws cli`, but `$shutdown` from within the ec2 system, then stop(default) or terminate will be performed(two options)
  - termination protection `only protect against termination of aws console or aws cli`
- ec2 launch troublshooting
  - **InstanceLimitExceeded**: means that you have reached your limit of max number of vCPUs per region
    - Note: vCPU-based limits only apply to running On-Demand instances and Spot instances
  - **InsufficientInstanceCapacity**: means AWS does not have that enough On-Demand capacity in the particular AZ where the instance is launched.
  - **InstanceTerminates Immediately**: goes from pending to terminated
    - reach EBS volume limit
    - EBS snapshot is corrupt
    - root EBS is encrypted, but you have no permission to decrypt it
    - AMI is missing some required part
- ec2 ssh troubleshooting
  - make sure the permission code `400` for the private key file`.pem`
  - make sure the username for the OS is giving correctly when logging via ssh.
  - `connection time out`: SG/NACL is not configured correctly; check the route table; instance does not have a public ip; cpu load is high...
- ssh vs ec2 instance connect(one time public key)
- ec2 instance purchasing options
  - on-demand instance
  - reserved(1 or 3 years): reserved instances / convertible reserved instances
  - savings plans(1 or 3 years): commitment to an amount of usage
  - spot instances
  - dedicated hosts: compliance requirement or use your own existing server-bound software licenses
  - dedicated instances
  - capacity reservations: combine with reserved or saving plans
- ec2 spot instance requests
  - max spot price: otherwise choose to stop/terminate with a 2 min grace period
  - spot block: (1 - 6 hours) 
  - not for critical jobs or databases
  - cancel a spot request does not terminate instances. So first cancel a spot request, and then terminate instances
- spot fleets: set of Spot Instances + (optional) On-Demand Instances
  - try to meet the target capacity with price constraints
  - allow to automatically request spot instances with lowest price
  - strategies to allocate spot instances:
    - lowestPrices
    - diversified
    - capacityOptimized
    - priceCapacityOptimized
- bustable instances(T2/T3)
  - when a spike of load strikes, cpu can burst using `burst credits`, if all the credits are gone, then cpu will become `BAD`.
  - when a machine stops bursting, then credits are accumulated over time.
  - but if your instances consistently runs low on credits, maybe it is the time to change to a non-burstable instance
- T2/T3 unlimited: extra money, be careful
- Elastic IPs
  - do not pay for it when using it
  - pay for it when not using it
  - can have up to 5 elastic ip
  - should avoid using it
- cloudwatch metrics for ec2
  - aws provided metrics: basic monitoring(default), detail monitoring(pay), no RAM included (CPU, network, status check(instance status, system status, attached EBS status), disk)
  - custom metric 
- unified cloudwatch agent
  - procstat plugin: Collect metrics and monitor system utilization of individual processes. support both linux and windows
- status checks
  - system status checks: aws systems(software and hardware), (`personal health dashboard`), stop and start the instance
  - instance status checks: reboot the instance
  - EBS status checks: reboot the instance or replace EBS
- status checks - cloudwatch metric and recovery
  - cloudwatch alarm: action - recovery
  - auto scaling group
- ec2 hibernate
  - write RAM state into root EBS volume; the EBS volume must be encrypted
  - instance RAM: less than 150 GB
  - available for on-demand, reserved, spot
  - hibernate no more than 60 days



## AMI

- overview:
  - a customization of ec2: configure system, software
  - built for a specific region
  - launch ec2 instances from: public ami, custom ami, or aws marketplace ami
- ami process: start ec2 instance, customize it, stop it, and make an ami, then launch instances from the ami
- ami no-reboot option: by default, aws will shutdown the instance before taking an EBS snapshot and create an AMI. But we can choose no-reboot option, then the system buffer will not be sent to disk before the snapshot is created
- aws backup plans to create ami:
  - aws backup does not reboot the instance when taking ebs snapshot(no-reboot behavior)
  - since it does not stop the instance while taking snapshot, so it is not guaranteed the file system integrity
  - to maintain integrity, you need to provide `reboot` parameter while taking images( eventbridge + lambda + createImage api with reboot)
- cross-account amia sharing: sharing does not affect the ownership of the ami.
  - can only share amis without encrypted volumes or the volumes encrypted with CMK(you must share the CMK as well)
- cross-account ami copy: if you copy the ami shared with you, then you are the new owner of the copy
  - the owner of source ami must give read permission of the ebs snapshot which backs the ami
  - if the backing snapshot is encrypted, then the owner must share the key
- ec2 image builder
  - used to automate the creation, maintain,validate, test of ami
- ami in production
  - force users to only launch ec2 with pre-approved amis(tagged with specific tags) using iam policies(using condition to check tags)
  - combine with aws config to find non-compliant ec2 instances

 

## Manage EC2 at scale System manager

- overview: help manage ec2 and on-prem systems; automation; detection; work for windows and linux; integrated with cloudwatch metrics; integrated with aws config
- SSM agent: installed by default on aws linux ami; make sure the ec2 instances have a proper iam role to allow ssm actions
- aws Tags: a service that can add key-value pairs(tags) to other aws resources(like ec2), which can be used to group or identify resources, automation,... (better to have too many than too few)
- create, view, manage logical group of resources thanks to `Tags`
  - applications, different layers of app stack, prod vs dev env
  - regional service
  - ec2, s3, dynamodb, lambda...
- ssm document: like scripts, but written in json or yml
  - we define parameters, actions
  - also there are existing aws documents
- ssm run-command: execute ssm documents or just a command
  - run command across multiple resources (resource group)
  - rate control/error control
  - integrated with iam, cloudtrail
  - no need for ssh
  - the output can be seen in the console, or sent to s3 or cloudwatch logs
  - send notifications to sns
  - can be invoked using eventbridge
- ssm automation: Simplifies common maintenance and deployment tasks of EC2 instances and other AWS resources
  - Automation runbook: ssm document of type automation
  - pre-defined runbooks(aws) or create custom runbooks
  - can be triggered: console, cli, sdk, eventbridge, on a schedule using `maintenance window`, aws config for rules remediations
- ssm parameter store: secure storage for configuration and secret; notification with aws eventbridge; integrated with cloudformation
- ssm parameter store hierarchy
- ssm parameter store advanced
  - parameter policies: allow to apply a TTL
- ssm inventory
  - collect metadata from your managed instances(ec2/on-prem)
  - metadata: installed software, os driver, configurations, updates,...
  - view data in aws console, or store in s3 and query using athena and quicksight
  - specify the metadata collection interval
  - can create custom inventory
- ssm state manager
  - automate the process of keeping your managed instances (ec2/on-prem) in a state that you define
  - use cases: patch os/software updates on a schedule,...
  - `state manager association`: Defines the state that you want to maintain to your managed instances. Specify a schedule when this configuration is applied
  - Uses SSM Documents to create an Association (e.g., SSM Document to configure CW Agent)
- ssm patch manager: Automates the process of patching managed instances
  - Patch on-demand or on a schedule using Maintenance Windows
  - Scan instances and generate patch compliance report (missing patches)
  - Patch compliance report can be sent to S3
  - patch baseline: Defines which patches should and shouldnâ€™t be installed on your instances
    - pre-define patch baseline: `AWS-RunPatchBaseline (SSM Document)` apply both operating system and application patches 
    - custom patch baseline
  - patch group: Associate a set of instances with a specific Patch Baseline; one patch group with one patch baseline
- ssm maintenance window: Defines a schedule for when to perform actions on your instances
- ssm session manager: Allows you to start a secure shell on your EC2 and on- premises servers. Does not need SSH access, bastion hosts, or SSH keys
  - session logs: sent to s3 or cloudwatch logs
